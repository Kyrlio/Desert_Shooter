# Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Complete architectural refactoring of the player and multiplayer systems to improve maintainability, separation of concerns, and code clarity.

## Changes Made

### 1. Component-Based Architecture

#### Created New Components:

**PlayerInputController** (`/scenes/entities/player/components/player_input_controller.gd`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized input handling for a single player
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Gathers all input actions (movement, aim, fire, dash, block, weapon/skin cycling)
  - Handles hybrid mouse/gamepad input with automatic switching
  - Emits signals for all player actions
  - Manages cursor visibility based on input method
- **Key Methods**:
  - `gather_input()`: Collects all input for the current frame
  - `get_effective_aim(aim_root)`: Returns mouse or gamepad aim direction
  - `handle_input_event()`: Detects mouse movement for input switching

**PlayerSkinManager** (`/scenes/entities/player/components/player_skin_manager.gd`)
- **Purpose**: Manages player skin/appearance
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Applies skins from PlayerSkin resources
  - Handles skin cycling with wrapping
  - Creates AtlasTexture regions from spritesheet
- **Key Methods**:
  - `apply_skin(index)`: Sets sprite texture from skin definition
  - `cycle_skin(direction)`: Switches to next/previous skin
  - `set_skin_by_id()`, `set_skin_by_name()`: Direct skin setters

**PlayerWeaponManager** (`/scenes/entities/player/components/player_weapon_manager.gd`)
- **Purpose**: Weapon inventory and firing logic
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manages weapon array and currently equipped weapon
  - Handles weapon cycling with wrapping
  - Delegates firing to current weapon
  - Calls weapon lifecycle methods (on_equipped, on_unequipped)
- **Key Methods**:
  - `equip_weapon(instance)`: Switches active weapon
  - `try_fire(aim_vector, can_fire)`: Attempts to fire current weapon
  - `cycle_weapon(direction)`: Switches to next/previous weapon

**GameConfig** (`/scripts/game_config.gd`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized configuration constants
- **Contents**:
  - `MAX_PLAYERS = 4`
  - `ACTION_DEADZONE = 0.2`
  - `BASE_MOVEMENT_SPEED = 100.0`
  - `ACTION_SUFFIXES` array with all input action names
  - `get_player_prefix(index)`: Helper to generate "playerN_" prefix

### 2. Player Refactoring

**Before**: 374 lines of monolithic code
**After**: ~185 lines of orchestrator pattern

**Changes**:
- Removed direct input handling → Delegated to `PlayerInputController`
- Removed skin management logic → Delegated to `PlayerSkinManager`
- Removed weapon management logic → Delegated to `PlayerWeaponManager`
- Added `_initialize_components()`: Creates components programmatically and wires signals
- Simplified to signal handlers that coordinate between components
- Added getter methods for FSM compatibility:
  - `get_movement_vector()`
  - `is_dash_pressed()`
  - `is_blocking()`
  
**Signal Flow**:
```
InputController.fire_requested → Player._on_fire_requested() → WeaponManager.try_fire()
InputController.dash_requested → Player._on_dash_requested() → State machine
InputController.weapon_cycled → Player._on_weapon_cycled() → WeaponManager.cycle_weapon()
InputController.skin_cycled → Player._on_skin_cycled() → SkinManager.cycle_skin()
```

### 3. State Machine Updates

Updated all FSM states to use player getter methods instead of direct property access:
- `idle_state.gd`
- `running_state.gd`  
- `dashing_state.gd`

**Changes**:
- `player.movement_vector` → `player.get_movement_vector()`
- Direct input checks → `player.is_dash_pressed()`, etc.
- Dash direction fallback uses `input_controller.get_effective_aim()`

### 4. Main Scene Refactoring

**Updated** (`/scenes/main_scene/main.gd`)
- Removed local constants: `MAX_PLAYERS`, `ACTION_DEADZONE`, `ACTION_SUFFIXES`
- All methods now use `GameConfig` references
- Updated prefix generation: `"player%d_" %` → `GameConfig.get_player_prefix()`
- Fixed button mapping conflict (removed `LEFT_SHOULDER` from dash)
- Removed `base_player.allow_mouse_aim = true` (handled in component)

**Affected Methods**:
- `_configure_actions_for_player()`
- `_clear_actions_for_player()`
- `_strip_gamepad_events_for_prefix()`
- `_ensure_action_exists()`
- `_get_available_player_index()`
- `_remove_device_bindings_for_player()`

## Benefits

### Separation of Concerns
- Input logic isolated in `PlayerInputController`
- Skin management isolated in `PlayerSkinManager`
- Weapon management isolated in `PlayerWeaponManager`
- Player class becomes a clean orchestrator

### Maintainability
- Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
- Components can be tested independently
- Changes to input handling don't affect weapon logic, etc.

### Reusability
- Components could potentially be reused for AI players
- Configuration centralized in `GameConfig` for easy tuning
- Clear interfaces between systems

### Readability
- Each component has a single, clear responsibility
- Signal-based communication is explicit and traceable
- Reduced cognitive load when reading code

## Controller Mapping

**Movement**: Left stick (analog)
**Aim**: Right stick (analog) or Mouse
**Fire**: Right trigger (analog)
**Block**: Left trigger (analog)
**Dash**: A button or Right stick click
**Weapon Cycle**: D-pad Left/Right
**Skin Cycle**: Left/Right shoulder buttons

## Next Steps

Potential further improvements:
- [ ] Update `player.tscn` to remove old @export variables
- [ ] Test all systems thoroughly after refactoring
- [ ] Consider creating `LocalMultiplayerManager` singleton
- [ ] Add component initialization error handling
- [ ] Document component APIs for future developers
